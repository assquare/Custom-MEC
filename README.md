# Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) API with Flask
This project gives a custom MEC implementation based on 3GPP specifications
It implements the Edge Configuration Server (ECS) as the registration entity of components such as Edge Application Server (EAS)
While relying on 3GPP and ETSI specifications, the MEC architecture is redefined to fit our needs for a custom MEC testbed.

As the original MEC architecture is quite complexe, this project allows developers to have a starting point on edge developments.
